# RCR Draft

## Abstract

This artifact accompanies the TOSEM paper on C2|Q> and provides reviewer-oriented support for reproducing the paper’s core computational results. The artifact includes the framework source code, a released parser model archive, deterministic JSON inputs, validation scripts, a smoke reproduction path, a paper-scale reproduction path, and experiment-specific output directories under `artifacts/`.

## Overview

Paper:
- [INSERT DOI]
- [INSERT FINAL TOSEM TITLE]

Repository:
- C2|Q> source tree

Primary artifact goals:
- verify that the framework can construct quantum-ready representations from supported inputs
- reproduce the paper’s deployment evaluation outputs
- reproduce the smoke-scale full-workflow validation path
- reproduce implementation-level and algorithmic/structural validation outputs

## Citation and Summary of the TOSEM Paper

[INSERT CITATION]

Short summary:
- C2|Q> bridges classical problem specifications and quantum software artifacts through parser, reduction, generation, execution, and reporting components.

## Artifact Inventory

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Framework source | `src/` | Main implementation |
| Parser model setup helper | `tools/setup_model.py` | Model installation and checking |
| Paper reproduction runner | `tools/reproduce_paper.py` | Smoke and paper-scale report reproduction |
| Recommender experiment pipeline | `scripts/recommender_maxcut_pipeline.py` | Experiment 2 regeneration |
| Smoke pipeline | `scripts/artifact_smoke.py` | Fast reviewer verification |
| Dataset validation | `src/parser/validate_dataset.py` | Supporting validation, not a numbered paper experiment |
| JSON DSL interface | `src/json_engine.py` | Supplementary JSON-based reproduction path |

## Prerequisites and Requirements

- Python 3.12
- LaTeX / `pdflatex`
- released parser model archive
- optional Docker for isolated reviewer execution

See:
- [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md)
- [REQUIREMENTS.md](../REQUIREMENTS.md)

## Setup

1. Create and activate a Python 3.12 virtual environment.
2. Install the project with:

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

3. Install the released parser model with:

```bash
make model-setup
```

If scripted download is blocked in a given environment, download the model archive in a browser and then run:

```bash
make model-setup MODEL_ARCHIVE=/path/to/saved_models_2025_12.zip
```

4. Run:

```bash
make doctor
```

## Steps to Reproduce

### Minimal Reviewer Path

```bash
make smoke
make reproduce-json-smoke
```

### Main Experiment Paths

Experiment 1 is supported primarily through archived notebook/results provenance:

```text
src/parser/parser_train_results_12_1.ipynb
src/parser/results/
```

Experiment 2:

```bash
make recommender-maxcut
```

Experiment 3:

```bash
make reproduce-smoke
make reproduce-json-smoke
make validate-dataset
```

### Extended Path

```bash
make reproduce-paper
```

This extended run is time-consuming and expected to take roughly 10 hours.

## Output Locations

- smoke output: `artifacts/smoke/`
- JSON smoke output: `artifacts/reproduce/json/smoke/`
- recommender output: `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/`
- validation output: `artifacts/parser_validation/`
- paper smoke / paper full output: `artifacts/reproduce/{smoke,paper}/`

## Limitations

- parser training notebook provenance is archived but not part of the minimal reviewer path
- optional cloud-provider integrations are outside the required artifact path
- the full paper run is significantly slower than the smoke path
- [INSERT ANY FINAL CAMERA-READY LIMITATIONS]
