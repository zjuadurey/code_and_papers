## What To Run

Use these commands as the main entry points for the paper-backed artifact paths:

| Purpose | Command                                                                | Model required | Main output |
|---|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|
| Optional Docker image build | `make docker-build`                                                    | No | Docker image `c2q:latest` |
| Experiment 1: encoder evaluation assets | notebook/manual assets in `src/parser/parser_train_results_12_1.ipynb` | No | `src/parser/parser_train_results_12_1.ipynb` |
| Experiment 2: deployment evaluation | `make recommender-maxcut`                                              | No | `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/` |
| Experiment 3: Python-code smoke reproduction | `make reproduce-smoke`                                                 | Yes | `artifacts/reproduce/smoke/` |
| Experiment 3: Python-code full reproduction | `make reproduce-paper`                                                 | Yes | `artifacts/reproduce/paper/` |
| Experiment 3: JSON smoke reproduction | `make reproduce-json-smoke`                                            | No | `artifacts/reproduce/json/smoke/` |
| Experiment 3: JSON full reproduction | `make reproduce-json-paper`                                            | No | `artifacts/reproduce/json/paper/` |
| Supporting validation only | `make validate-dataset`                                                | Yes | `artifacts/parser_validation/` |

All generated outputs from the `make`-based experiment paths are written under `artifacts/`.

## Repository Layout

- `src/` – framework source code
- `src/parser/` – parser code, training notebook, checkpoints, model helpers
- `src/c2q-dataset/` – JSON inputs and dataset assets
- `tools/` – reproducibility and environment helpers
- `scripts/` – experiment orchestration scripts
- `artifacts/` – generated outputs from reproducibility commands

## Reviewer Start Options

Choose one of these two entry paths:

- Lowest setup burden: Docker. This avoids installing Python locally.
- Fastest local iteration: source checkout with Python 3.12 or 3.13.

For the TOSEM RCR report, the recommended primary reproduction path is the source checkout path in Option B.
Python 3.12 remains the primary validated RCR environment; Python 3.13 is also supported through conditional dependency pins.
Use the Docker path in Option A as the lowest-barrier sanity check.
Hugging Face mirrors are optional community access points and are not part of the primary reviewer workflow.

## Option A: Docker (Lowest Setup Burden)

Use Docker if you do not want to install a compatible Python interpreter on the host machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/C2-Q/C2Q.git
cd C2Q
make docker-build
```

Minimal Docker verification:

```bash
make docker-reproduce-json-smoke
```

Notes:
- Docker commands use `/tmp/c2q-venv` inside the container
- host `.venv` is untouched
- outputs are still written under `artifacts/`
- `make docker-reproduce-json-smoke` does not require the parser model
- after installing the parser model, the next Docker check is `make docker-smoke`
- on Linux/WSL, Docker Buildx may need to be installed separately; check with `docker buildx version`
- on Linux/WSL, if Docker daemon access is denied, either run the Docker make targets with `sudo` or add the user to the `docker` group and reopen the shell

## Option B: Source Checkout (Fastest Local Path)

Use this path if Python 3.12 or 3.13 is already available locally. Python 3.12 is the recommended RCR path; Python 3.13 can be used by replacing `python3.12` with `python3.13` and passing `PYTHON=python3.13` to `make` targets.

Primary shell path: `bash` or `zsh` on macOS / Linux.

Check it first:

```bash
python3.12 --version
# or
python3.13 --version
```

If neither `python3.12` nor `python3.13` is available:
- macOS:
  - `brew install python@3.12`
  - or install Python 3.12 from [python.org downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Linux:
  - install Python 3.12 or 3.13 using your distribution packages
  - then check with `python3.12 --version` or `python3.13 --version`
  - if Python 3.12 or 3.13 is not easily available, use the Docker path instead

```bash
git clone https://github.com/C2-Q/C2Q.git
cd C2Q
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For Python 3.13, use:

```bash
python3.13 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Windows PowerShell is supported as a secondary path.
Equivalent Python 3.12 commands:

```powershell
py -3.12 --version
git clone https://github.com/C2-Q/C2Q.git
cd C2Q
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

For Python 3.13 on Windows, replace `py -3.12` with `py -3.13` in the PowerShell commands above. The `make` targets are primarily documented for Unix-like shells; Windows users who want the exact RCR make workflow should use WSL or Docker.

If Python 3.12/3.13 is missing on Windows, install Python from [python.org downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/), then re-run `py -3.12 --version` or `py -3.13 --version`.

If PowerShell blocks activation, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If you only need the model-free JSON report path, you can stop here and run:

```bash
make reproduce-json-smoke
make reproduce-json-paper
```

If you want to continue to the model-backed Python-code path, install the parser model first in the next section, then run:

```bash
make doctor
```

`make doctor` checks Python, LaTeX, and parser-model availability for the model-backed route.

This source-checkout path is the recommended path for the main TOSEM RCR reproduction steps.

## Parser Model Setup

The parser model is not bundled in the Git repository or in PyPI because of file size.

Preferred scripted model archive:
- [saved_models_2025_12.zip (GitHub Release)](https://github.com/C2-Q/C2Q/releases/download/v1.0-artifact/saved_models_2025_12.zip)

Archival model record:
- [saved_models_2025_12.zip (Zenodo)](https://zenodo.org/records/19061126/files/saved_models_2025_12.zip?download=1)

Recommended reviewer setup:

```bash
make model-setup MODEL_ARCHIVE=/path/to/saved_models_2025_12.zip
```

What `make model-setup` does:
- installs into the default path: `src/parser/saved_models_2025_12`
- first looks for a local archive in common locations such as `~/Downloads/saved_models_2025_12.zip`
- if you already have the archive somewhere else, pass it explicitly:

```bash
make model-setup MODEL_ARCHIVE=/path/to/saved_models_2025_12.zip
```

- if no local archive is found, it tries the configured release URL as a best-effort fallback

Reviewer note:
- the GitHub Release asset above works with scripted download and is the preferred automation target
- the Zenodo record remains the archival copy
- if scripted download is blocked in a given environment, browser download plus `make model-setup MODEL_ARCHIVE=...` is still the fallback reviewer path

Recommended installation path:
1. Run:

```bash
make model-setup
```

2. If you want to install from a browser-downloaded zip instead, download either archive above and then run:

```bash
make model-setup MODEL_ARCHIVE=/path/to/saved_models_2025_12.zip
```

3. Verify it:

```bash
make model-check
```

Equivalent manual helper:

```bash
python tools/setup_model.py --archive /path/to/saved_models_2025_12.zip --model-path src/parser/saved_models_2025_12
```

Most robust manual installation path:
1. Download the archive in a browser from the GitHub Release asset above.
2. Install it with:

```bash
make model-setup MODEL_ARCHIVE=/path/to/saved_models_2025_12.zip
```

Optional helper:

```bash
make model-setup
make model-download
```

Use `make model-download` only as a convenience path. `make model-setup` is now the preferred command because the default source points to the GitHub Release asset. Browser download plus `MODEL_ARCHIVE=...` remains the most robust route across environments.

Required files inside the model directory:
- `config.json`
- `tokenizer_config.json`
- one weight file: `model.safetensors` or `pytorch_model.bin`

Commands that require the parser model:
- `make smoke`
- `make reproduce-smoke`
- `make reproduce-paper`
- `make validate-dataset`
- `make verify-model`
- `make docker-smoke`

Commands that do not require the parser model:
- `make reproduce-json-smoke`
- `make reproduce-json-paper`
- `make recommender-maxcut`
- `make docker-reproduce-json-smoke`
- `make docker-recommender-maxcut`

Additional Docker commands:

```bash
make docker-reproduce-json-smoke
make docker-reproduce-json-paper
make docker-recommender-maxcut
make docker-validate-dataset
make docker-paper
```

## Experiments Used In The Paper

### Experiment 1: Encoder Evaluation

In the paper, Experiment 1 evaluates the input-analysis / encoder module on 434 synthetic Python code snippets. The reported headline results are a weighted-average F1 score of 98.2% for problem classification and a 93.8% completion rate for data extraction.

Main assets:
- notebook with training and recorded evaluation outputs: `src/parser/parser_train_results_12_1.ipynb`
- intermediate checkpoints: `src/parser/results/`
- released trained model archive: [GitHub Release zip](https://github.com/C2-Q/C2Q/releases/download/v1.0-artifact/saved_models_2025_12.zip)

This experiment is primarily supported through archived notebook/results provenance rather than a first-line `make` target. The minimal reviewer path uses the released model rather than retraining.

### Experiment 2: Deployment Evaluation

Run:

```bash
make recommender-maxcut
```

This path does **not** require the parser model.

Outputs:
- raw recommender CSVs and plots: `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/raw_csv/`
- post-processed Algorithm 1 outputs: `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/algorithm1/`

Key files:
- `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/raw_csv/errors_wide.csv`
- `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/raw_csv/times_wide.csv`
- `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/raw_csv/prices_wide.csv`
- `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/raw_csv/recommender_output_errors.pdf`
- `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/raw_csv/recommender_output_prices.pdf`
- `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/raw_csv/recommender_output_times.pdf`
- `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/algorithm1/winners.csv`
- `artifacts/recommender_maxcut/algorithm1/details.csv`

This corresponds to the paper’s deployment / hardware recommender evaluation on workloads scaling up to 56 qubits.

For the RCR path, the recommender uses versioned provider/device metadata stored in the repository and package data. Live provider APIs, calibration snapshots, queue state, device availability, and pricing can change over time and often require credentials. The cached metadata makes Experiment 2 runnable offline and comparable against the archived outputs. Extending the recommender to new devices is done by adding or refreshing the corresponding provider metadata/device descriptor files and rerunning the recommender pipeline.

### Experiment 3: Full Workflow Validation (Python and JSON Paths)

Python-code report path:

```bash
make reproduce-smoke
make reproduce-paper
```

This path requires the parser model.

Outputs:
- smoke path: `artifacts/reproduce/smoke/`
- paper path: `artifacts/reproduce/paper/`

JSON example report path:

```bash
make reproduce-json-smoke
make reproduce-json-paper
```

This path does **not** require the parser model.

Outputs:
- smoke path: `artifacts/reproduce/json/smoke/`
- paper path: `artifacts/reproduce/json/paper/`

The curated JSON smoke subset currently includes one example each for `ADD`, `Factor`, `MaxCut`, and `MIS`.

The full Python paper run is time-consuming and takes roughly **10 hours**.
The full JSON paper run is slower than the smoke path, takes roughly **2 hours**, and is intentionally not run by default here.

This path corresponds to the paper’s end-to-end validation on 434 Python programs and 100 JSON problem instances.
The associated paper data record is [C2|Q> Dataset: Reports and Evaluation Inputs (v1.0.0)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17071667).

The paper also reports a proxy-based usability analysis. Those supporting materials are part of the archived evaluation record rather than a primary `make` target in this repository.

### Supporting Validation (Not a Numbered Paper Experiment)

Run:

```bash
make validate-dataset
```

This path requires the parser model.

Outputs:
- implementation-level validation: `artifacts/parser_validation/implementation/`
- algorithmic/structural validation: `artifacts/parser_validation/diversity/`

Key files:
- `artifacts/parser_validation/implementation/snippet_metrics.csv`
- `artifacts/parser_validation/implementation/family_summary.csv`
- `artifacts/parser_validation/implementation/syntax_failures.csv`
- `artifacts/parser_validation/diversity/summary_by_tag.csv`
- `artifacts/parser_validation/diversity/algorithm_diversity_summary.csv`
- `artifacts/parser_validation/diversity/algorithm_signals_per_instance.csv`

## Tests

Fast default tests:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest
```

Model-backed tests:

```bash
make verify-model
```

## PyPI Installation

For lightweight CLI/API use without cloning the repo:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade c2q-framework
```

PyPI installs are supported on **Python 3.12 and 3.13** for this release. Python 3.14 is not currently part of the supported artifact path.

Optional extras:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade "c2q-framework[parser]"
python -m pip install --upgrade "c2q-framework[recommender]"
python -m pip install --upgrade "c2q-framework[artifact]"
python -m pip install --upgrade "c2q-framework[cloud]"
```

Use them as follows:
- `parser`: installs the parser-related Python dependencies only; the parser model archive is still downloaded and installed separately
- `recommender`: CSV export and experiment helpers
- `artifact`: installs the heavier parser + recommender Python dependencies used by the repository artifact path; it is most useful together with a source checkout, not as a pure PyPI-only workflow
- `cloud`: optional live-provider SDK integrations; currently supported only on Python 3.12 because some provider SDK dependency chains do not yet support Python 3.13

The `parser` extra does **not** download or install the trained model automatically. For parser-backed use, install the model archive separately with `make model-setup` from a source checkout, or extract the released model archive into your chosen `model_path` and pass that path to the `Parser` API.

If you are using the PyPI path without cloning the repository:
- download the parser model archive from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/C2-Q/C2Q/releases/download/v1.0-artifact/saved_models_2025_12.zip) or the [Zenodo archival copy](https://zenodo.org/records/19061126/files/saved_models_2025_12.zip?download=1)
- extract it manually into a directory of your choice
- pass that directory to the parser API as `model_path`

PyPI is intended for lightweight CLI/API use. The paper-backed `make reproduce-*`, `make validate-dataset`, and Docker reviewer paths belong to the source repository workflow, not the pure PyPI workflow.

Check the installed version:

```bash
python -m pip show c2q-framework
```

CLI help:

```bash
c2q-json -h
```

Minimal model-free PyPI run:

```bash
cat > mis_01.json <<'EOF'
{
  "family": "MIS",
  "goal": "find a maximum independent set of the graph",
  "description": "Minimal MIS example",
  "instance": {
    "graph_rep": "edge_list",
    "graphs": {
      "G1": [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]
    }
  }
}
EOF

c2q-json --input mis_01.json
```

Expected result:
- generates a PDF report in the current working directory
- does not require the parser model

If you are on Windows PowerShell, create `mis_01.json` with the same content in any text editor, then run:

```powershell
c2q-json --input mis_01.json
```

## Programming Interface

Current import namespace is `src.*`.

JSON DSL from Python, without any repository-local files:

```python
from src.json_engine import normalise_task

task = {
    "family": "MIS",
    "goal": "find a maximum independent set of the graph",
    "instance": {
        "graph_rep": "edge_list",
        "graphs": {"G1": [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]},
    },
}
family, instance, params, goal = normalise_task(task)
print(family, instance)
```

Parser usage:

```python
from src.parser.parser import Parser

parser = Parser(model_path="/path/to/saved_models_2025_12")
family, data = parser.parse("def add(a,b):\n    return a+b\n")
print(family, type(data).__name__)
```

The parser API requires the `parser` extra in PyPI installs.

Generate a report via Python API:

```python
from src.graph import Graph
from src.problems.maximal_independent_set import MIS

edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [0, 3], [0, 2]]
problem = MIS(Graph(edges).G)
problem.report_latex(output_path="API_demo_report")
```

## JSON DSL CLI Example

Repository example:

```bash
c2q-json --input src/c2q-dataset/inputs/json_dsl/mis/mis_01.json
```

This command parses the JSON problem, generates the quantum workflow, and writes a PDF report.

Regenerate the maintained JSON DSL example set under `src/c2q-dataset/inputs/json_dsl/`:

```bash
make json-dsl-examples
```

Generate PDF reports for a curated smoke subset of those JSON DSL examples:

```bash
make reproduce-json-smoke
```

The curated smoke subset currently includes one example each for `ADD`, `Factor`, `MaxCut`, and `MIS`.

If you want the lowest-setup reviewer check, use:

```bash
make docker-reproduce-json-smoke
```

This path does not require a local Python installation or the parser model.

Generate PDF reports for the full JSON DSL example set:

```bash
make reproduce-json-paper
```

Outputs are written to:
- smoke: `artifacts/reproduce/json/smoke/`
- paper: `artifacts/reproduce/json/paper/`

The full JSON reproduction path is intentionally not run by default here because it is slow and takes roughly 2 hours.
